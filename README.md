# PythonRPGDieRoller

Intended to be a small, flexible dice roller for RPG style games and programs.

The idea is that you simply throw a roll at it, and you get a result.

That can be expanded on later;
	returning individual results from a multi-die roll,
	allowing multiple pools to be rolled at the same time such as 1d8+1 + 2d4+1,
	splitting d20 and d100 from other rolls, as they are a bit special.


At the moment, it's a total mess.  With some refinement and feature expansion, it will be a powerful little tool.

The goal is to make it available in the pypi repository so it can be imported for other python users who want a simple dice roller.
